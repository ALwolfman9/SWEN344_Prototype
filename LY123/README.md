### Prerequisites

XCode will need to be up to date on your machine. This may require you to update your mac or update the mac you are remote accessing into to run the IOS version of the project.
Make sure in the info.plist file the version of IOS is set higher than 9.0.

## Operations

Once the game is set up, build the project and run on your choice of device from the Simulator option. From there, the app will open to the sign in page. Create an account and login. Once in, if you do not have a class, you can start the game with the questions already in the system. If you have a class code, go to my class and enter the code, this should acces your school class and give options for more questions.
